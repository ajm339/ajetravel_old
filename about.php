          <p class="tab">My name is Darlene Hopkins, wife to an amazing husband, and mother of three wonderful boys. I graduated in 1980 from the Wilma Boyd Career School of Travel in Pittsburgh, PA, and have since obtained my Certified Travel Associate (CTA) from the Travel Institue (2000). Travel has been a passion of mine for over 30 years. </p>
          <p class="tab">I enjoy booking trips of all kinds-from sporting events for the entire family to romantic getaways for honeymooners. Whether you prefer to ride in style, sail the ocean blue, fly the friendly skies to the wonderful world of Walt Disney in sunny Florida and California, or bus your way to the Big Apple for the Radio City Christmass Spectacular-I do it all. Let me take the Woes out of planning your trip-vacation is vacation. I look forward to helping you embark on your next adventure!</p>
